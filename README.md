# Startup Health Scoring Model
## ScaleDux AI Intern Task 1 - Complete Analysis & Documentation

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This project implements a comprehensive **Startup Health Scoring Model** that evaluates 100 fictional startups based on key business indicators, generating composite scores from 0-100. The model uses weighted normalization techniques to assess startup potential across six critical dimensions.

### Key Results:
- **Score Range**: 15.89 to 84.32 (out of 100)
- **Average Score**: 49.85
- **Top Performer**: S059 (Score: 84.32)
- **Bottom Performer**: S023 (Score: 15.89)

---

## 🎯 Methodology & Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing Strategy

**Normalization Technique**: Min-Max Scaling (0-1 range)
- **Positive Features**: Higher values = Better scores
  - Team Experience, Market Size, Monthly Active Users, Funds Raised, Valuation
- **Negative Features**: Higher values = Lower scores (inverted)
  - Monthly Burn Rate (financial inefficiency indicator)

### 2. Scoring Formula Design

**Weight Distribution** (Based on startup evaluation best practices):

| Feature | Weight | Justification |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Monthly Active Users | 25% | **Traction is King** - Demonstrates product-market fit |
| Team Experience | 20% | **Execution Capability** - Experience predicts success |
| Valuation | 15% | **Market Validation** - External assessment of worth |
| Market Size | 15% | **Opportunity Scale** - Total addressable market potential |
| Monthly Burn Rate | 15% | **Financial Efficiency** - Capital allocation effectiveness |
| Funds Raised | 10% | **Investor Confidence** - Third-party validation signal |

**Final Score Calculation**:
```
Composite Score = Σ(Normalized_Feature_i × Weight_i) × 100
```

### 3. Feature Handling Logic

**Why These Weights?**
- **User Traction (25%)**: The highest weight because monthly active users directly indicate product-market fit and growth potential
- **Team Experience (20%)**: Second highest because experienced teams execute better and pivot smarter
- **Burn Rate (15%)**: Inverted scoring because high burn without proportional traction indicates poor capital efficiency
- **Market & Valuation (15% each)**: Important but secondary to execution metrics
- **Funding (10%)**: Lowest weight as it's often influenced by timing and connections rather than pure merit

## 📊 Key Insights & Patterns

### 1. **Success Drivers Analysis**

**High Performers Characteristics**:
- Average team experience: **7.1 years** (vs 5.5 overall)
- Average monthly users: **71,849** (vs 51,205 overall)  
- Average market size: **$515M** (vs $525M overall)
- Average burn rate: **₹5.6M** (vs ₹5.5M overall)

**Low Performers Characteristics**:
- Average team experience: **3.4 years** (significantly lower)
- Average monthly users: **33,891** (well below average)
- Average market size: **$366M** (smaller opportunities)
- Average burn rate: **₹4.8M** (surprisingly lower, but with poor traction)

### 2. **Critical Success Patterns**

✅ **Winning Formula**: High user traction + Experienced team + Reasonable burn rate
✅ **Market Size**: Important but not decisive - execution matters more
✅ **Valuation**: Often reflects other metrics - not always predictive alone
❌ **Common Failure**: Low experience teams struggle regardless of market size

### 3. **Investment Insights**

- **Top Quartile** (Score > 63.7): Strong investment candidates with proven traction
- **Second Quartile** (Score 49.9-63.7): Promising but need deeper evaluation  
- **Third Quartile** (Score 36.1-49.9): High-risk, potential pivot candidates
- **Bottom Quartile** (Score < 36.1): Avoid or require major restructuring
